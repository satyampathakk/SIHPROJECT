"This is a functional prototype that incorporates machine learning predictive analysis, which is yet to be fully integrated. I've included the machine learning model, and you can easily upload your CSV file by making some minor adjustments. This implementation represents our team's solution for the SIH problem statement: identifying slow learners for remedial tutoring using innovative methods. The project features a basic working frontend, which I've developed from the backend to the frontend. We're actively discussing additional features with our team. The project is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Django for the backend and includes machine learning models."
